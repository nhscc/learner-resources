This document details a general blueprint and current best practices for running
the Black Data Processing Association's (BDPA) national High School Computer
Competition (HSCC).

## What Is The High School Computer Competition?

Throughout the year, [local BDPA chapters](https://bdpa.org/about-us) conduct
[SITES training programs](https://bdpa.site-ym.com/page/Student_Programs) for
the youth in their communities. These programs are designed to expose students
to a variety of Computer Science and IT concepts from complex software
engineering and web design challenges to database administration, project
management, graphic and interface design, and supervision of deployments in
production.

[Once a year](https://bdpa.site-ym.com/page/PastBDPAConferences), chapters
select their most capable students to compete in the
[_High School Computer Competition_ (HSCC)](https://2021.bdpa.org/hscc). The
HSCC is similar to a design-sprint or hackathon where student teams are given a
real-world scenario—a
[_problem statement_](https://github.com/nhscc/problem-statements)—and must
collaborate intensively over a several week period to create a functioning
software _solution_ to it. The competition concludes at BDPA's
[national conference](https://bdpa.site-ym.com/page/PastBDPAConferences), where
teams must further extend their solutions and pitch the totality of their work
to a panel of judges. Teams are evaluated based on how well their solution
satisfies the problem statement, how well they can justify their design
decisions to the judges, and other competition criteria.

In the end, winning teams' students are each awarded hundreds to _thousands_ of
dollars in scholarships.

## Guiding Principles

When running the competition and especially when coming up with a new problem
statement, there are three guiding principles to keep in mind:

### Solving Problem Statements (PS1) Is a Chapter-Wide Effort

Only a chapter's current students are allowed to physically _code_ their problem
statement (PS1) solution. This means even students that are not part of a
chapter's official competition team, _including students that would normally be
too young to compete_, can help write solution code so long as they are active
in the chapter's training program.

This also means chaperones, coordinators, and teachers/coaches are free to
assist students in any capacity so long as they are not actually _writing_
solution code. Coaches can observe, make suggestions, explain algorithms, answer
_any_ questions students might have, and even _teach the contents of the problem
statement itself_ as part of their training program. In this way, solving the
problem statement (PS1) could involve the whole chapter. This is encouraged!

### Problem Statements Are Modern and Realistic

Problem statements must be realistic and _current_. Students should come out of
their respective SITES/HSCC program having developed the confidence and domain
expertise necessary to pursue their own software-based entrepreneurial ambitions
or a build a career in industry.

### Problem Statements Foster Community Between HSCC/SITES Students

HSCC might be a "competition," but it is paramount students learn about and
network with each other—_the future of computer science_! Any problem statement
must be designed with this in mind. For instance: students from different teams
might notice one another's presence when interacting with a problem statement's
[globally available API backing store](https://github.com/nhscc/ghostmeme.api.hscc.bdpa.org).

## Actors

There are several actors involved at various phases throughout the competition.
The roles of certain actors (like judges) can change depending on if the
competition is [fully virtual or hybrid](#fully-virtual-vs-hybrid).

### HSCC National Team

#### Chief Judge

### Judge

Judges are tasked with evaluating teams' solutions, receiving teams'
presentations, and,
[if the conference is not virtual](#fully-virtual-vs-hybrid), observing how team
members interact with one another and work together to come up with a solution.

### Student

### Competition Team

### Coordinator

### Chaperone, Coach, or Parent

## Competition Layout

### Pre-Competition Phase

#### Fully Virtual vs Hybrid

### Phase 1: The Release of Problem Statement 1 (PS1)

### Phase 2: The Release of Problem Statement 2 (PS2)

### Phase 3: Standard Examination

### Phase 4: Team Presentations

### Post-Competition Phase

#### Score Calculation

## Rules for Participating Teams

1. A chapter can send at most `1` teams
2. Teams are allowed
