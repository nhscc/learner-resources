# Accessing an API

This example demos how to access the 2020 Airports API in JS and PHP.

## How to Use

1. Replace `APP_API_KEY` with your API key.
2. Open the command line (cmd) or the terminal and navigate to this
   subdirectory.
3. Run the JS version using Node.js >= 16 or the PHP version using PHP >= 8.1.

To run with Node.js:

```
node demo.mjs
```

To run with PHP 8.1+ (you may need to
[install `php8.x-curl`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6382539/call-to-undefined-function-curl-init)):

```
php demo.php
```
