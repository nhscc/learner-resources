# Judging

These are materials for judges and for those interested in how competition
submissions will be judged.

Also included is the macro-filled hscc-judgement-rubric Excel document. This can
be used to manually calculate the scores of participating teams in the event the
auto-scoring software misbehaves or scores must otherwise be computed manually.
