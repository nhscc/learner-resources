# How to Judge HSCC Submissions

These are instructions for how to judge part 1 and part 2 submissions.

## Judging Part 1 Submissions

### What You Need

- One or more contiguous blocks of free time
- A computer with internet access that you can install AWS WorkSpaces on
- The names and Reviewr submission data of the teams whose solutions you're
  responsible for judging
- If you're a code judge: sufficient programming experience in JavaScript, PHP,
  and/or Java
  - If you're assigned a project using a programming language you're unfamiliar
    with, let us know.
- Experience with web/app design and what makes a good website versus a bad
  website

### Judging a Solution

Once you log into Reviewr, you should see a list of submissions that you are
required to review. If you cannot see your submissions or there is some other
problem, feel free to contact NHSCC staff via Slack.

Each team has submitted a presentation video along with their submission. You
can choose to watch this video before going through these steps or you can watch
this video afterwards (at the end of the judging process). **We recommend you
follow these steps first and watch the presentation video only after step 4.**

1. Install AWS WorkSpaces for your OS
   [here](https://clients.amazonworkspaces.com/).

2. All AWS WorkSpaces should have been restarted and had their credentials
   changed. You will be provided the credentials and information for the teams
   you were assigned to review. For the team you're judging, enter their credentials (registration code, username, and password) into the AWS WorkSpaces client to login to their virtual machine.

   > Note that you may not have to enter the registration code more than once
   > since it does not change between teams.

3. Once you've booted up their virtual machine, follow the instructions given in
   the team's Reviewr submission under `RUN AND ACCESS INSTRUCTIONS` and `LOGIN
   AND (BRIEF) FEATURE USE INSTRUCTIONS` to run their solution. Use the browser
   given under `BROWSER CHOICE` to access their solution. Note that paths tothe
   solution's source code can be found under `SOURCE CODE PATH(S)`; any login
   credentials you might need for the solution as well as the presentation video
   can be found under `LOGIN CREDENTIALS AND VIDEO PRESENTATION`.

   > Note: if any of this information is missing or incorrect, let NHSCC staff
   > know immediately via Slack.

4. Follow the instructions given in the digital rubric to judge the submission,
   assigning scores to each requirement/category. Let us know of any
   difficulties you encounter or concerns you have through Slack.

   > Note: if you need to, you can download extra programs like VS Code if it
   > makes judging the teams' solutions easier for you.

   > **You should not modify any solution's source code.** If a solution does
   > not work for whatever reason, or if functionality cannot be verified (e.g.
   > if the login screen is broken and you can't access the rest of the app),
   > solutions should be scored 0 for all affected requirements.

5. Once you are done with your preliminary scoring, and only if you haven't
   already, watch the presentation video submitted by this team. Revise any
   scores accordingly.

6. Allow any unanswered questions or nagging concerns to guide you as you look
   over and finalize your judgement of this solution.

   **Be sure to add any issues you think the other judges should be made aware
   of to Reviewr's shared "judge comments" textarea. Sharing your insights and
   concerns about this solution will improve the judging process overall.

7. Finally, submit your scores for this team through Reviewr.
